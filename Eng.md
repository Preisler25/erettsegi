SCHOOLS CANNOT TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO DEAL WITH MONEY

    - Schools should mainly focus on giving student a stable ground for the rest of there life, and in an society which is hyper-focused on economical growth understanding how money works is more than important

    - Although your point is valid, we are living in the 21th century and simulators are a thing for a reason, what i mean is that you can try out thing befor you have to risk  your own money, and you will be able to be in situations, that you would try to avoid, or you would have to work so hard for it that you would risk losing it

    - Some parents may provide everything for there chiled, but we aren't living a dream, I my generation most guys are blindly following Andrew Tate and Idols like him, which shoud sound an alarm in your head, if you have heard him speak about money or women.

CONSUMER SOCIETY IS HARMFUL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

    - Consumer society is not only harmful for young people, but the whole human kind, just think about the vest majority of adds you consume every singe day and if you aren't aware of your toughts, you could easiely spend your savings on thing you don't need.

    - But why sould they work hard for thing which are in most cases not even essential to them. Would it be better if every one, would do a fair share of work and get the things he need, becaues in most cases where you work hard you are just making profit for investors and company owners who are already have every thing you would ever dream.

    - Okay but I am not saying that from today to tomorrow we should change the whole system but work for a better and fairer economical system where solidarity and not profiting on other's work is a thing.
